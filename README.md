TwinPixels is an application for viewing and comparing images side by side. It allows you to load pairs of images from entire folders or select files manually, features zoom and synchronized movement functions, and allows you to export comparative images. It is ideal for photographers, designers, historians, researchers, or anyone who needs to analyze images.

# EXECUTION
- Download the executable file “TwinPixels.exe” from the link provided by the developer.
- No installation required: simply run the “.exe” file by double-clicking it.
- If you use antivirus software, make sure it allows the file to run (false positives are common with .exe files).
- The executable file includes all necessary dependencies.
# USER INTERFACE
The interface is organized into three main areas:

Left panel:

# Auto Sync

- Status visible in the left panel (green=activated, red=deactivated).
- When activated: Zoom and movement work the same in both viewfinders.

# IMPORTANT 
- Selection order: In “Free selection,” choose the images in the exact order you want to pair them.
- Synchronization only works with images of identical dimensions. This does NOT mean that they must have the same content, only that they must have the same width and height in pixels.
